## Implementation Notes

This Knowledge Hub is implemented using markdown files with embedded HTML for layout and styling. In a production environment, these files would be enhanced with:

- CSS styling for the dashboard components and visualizations
- JavaScript interactivity for the tools, calculators, and dynamic elements
- Data visualization libraries for the charts, graphs, and interactive displays
- User authentication for personalized content and progress tracking
- Database integration for community features and user-generated content

To work with this Knowledge Hub locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Use a markdown previewer that supports HTML (like VS Code with the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension)
3. Navigate to `index.md` to start exploring the hub

## Production Deployment

For production deployment, these markdown files can be:

1. Processed by a static site generator (like Jekyll, Hugo, or Next.js)
2. Enhanced with CSS and JavaScript for interactivity
3. Deployed to a web server or hosting platform
