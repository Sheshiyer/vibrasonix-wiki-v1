# Frontier Findings

Track the cutting edge of sound therapy research. Preview promising leads, novel protocols, and early results from ongoing investigations.

## ðŸš§ In Progress Highlights

- AI-assisted protocol personalization using multi-modal biometrics
- Cross-cultural studies of sound preferences and outcomes
- Collective synchrony experiments with global meditation events

## ðŸ§ª Early Signals (Pre-Registered)

- Theta layering improves transition stability for meditation beginners
- Beta entrainment with micro-recovery increases sustained attention beyond 60 minutes
- Delta priming shows durable gains when paired with environment control

## ðŸ“Œ Cautions

- Small sample sizesâ€”treat as directional, not definitive
- Publication bias and replication pending
- Protocol fidelity varies in uncontrolled environments
