# Research Radar: Study Summaries

A curated digest of notable studies in sound therapy, emphasizing clarity, rigor, and real-world application.

## ðŸ§ª Summaries by Outcome

### Sleep
- Delta priming reduces onset latency by 12â€“28 minutes; best results with environment optimization
- Theta bridge helps reduce early awakenings and enables smoother re-entry

### Focus
- Beta entrainment improves sustained attention in 50â€“90 minute sessions
- Micro-recovery pulses prevent cognitive fatigue and support output quality

### Calm
- Alpha protocols increase HRV and reduce subjective stress within 10â€“20 minutes
- Combining breath entrainment enhances outcomes and durability

### Meditation
- Theta layering improves depth stability, especially for beginners
- Silent consolidation at session end increases lasting state shifts

## ðŸ“Œ Practical Implications

- Protocol fidelity and environment are critical variables
- Track outcomes with both quantitative and qualitative measures
- Expect adaptation periodâ€”most gains consolidate over 2â€“4 weeks
