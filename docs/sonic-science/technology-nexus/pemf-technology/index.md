# PEMF Technology

Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) therapy uses electromagnetic fields to stimulate cellular repair, reduce inflammation, and optimize biological functions. In Vibrasonix systems, PEMF technology works synergistically with sound and vibration therapies to create comprehensive healing environments.

## Understanding Electromagnetic Biology

### Cellular Bioelectricity

Every cell in the human body operates as a biological battery:
