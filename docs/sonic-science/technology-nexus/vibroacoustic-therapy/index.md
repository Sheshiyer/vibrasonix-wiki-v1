# Vibroacoustic Therapy

Vibroacoustic Therapy (VAT) combines low-frequency sound waves with physical vibrations to create a powerful therapeutic modality. This technology delivers sound not only through the ears but directly through the body, creating a multi-dimensional healing experience that affects both physical and psychological well-being.

## Foundations of Vibroacoustic Therapy

### Historical Development

**Olav Skille (Norway, 1980s)**: Pioneer of modern vibroacoustic therapy
- Developed the first VAT equipment
- Established therapeutic protocols
- Documented clinical applications
- Founded the International Vibroacoustic Therapy Association

**Scientific Evolution**: From simple vibrating chairs to sophisticated multi-modal systems
- Integration with biofeedback
- Computerized frequency control
- Multi-channel delivery systems
- Real-time physiological monitoring

### Core Principles

**Mechanical Vibration**: Low-frequency sound waves (20-120 Hz) transmitted through the body
- Direct tissue stimulation
- Cellular massage effects
- Improved circulation
- Muscle relaxation

**Acoustic Resonance**: Body tissues resonate with specific frequencies
- Bone resonance: 20-80 Hz
- Muscle resonance: 40-100 Hz
- Organ resonance: 30-120 Hz
- Neural resonance: 8-40 Hz
