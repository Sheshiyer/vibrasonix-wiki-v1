# Journey Map: Focus Mastery Expedition

A structured, six-stage progression to develop reliable deep work capacity supported by sound therapy and environment design.

## 🗺️ Stages Overview

1. Orientation (Week 1): establish baseline and environment control
2. Activation (Weeks 2–3): build momentum with Deep Work Prime
3. Stabilization (Weeks 4–5): extend sessions and refine cadence
4. Optimization (Week 6): personalize timing and protocol layers
5. Expansion (Week 7): integrate creative flow practices
6. Consolidation (Week 8): maintain gains and prevent regression

## 🧪 Protocols Used

- Focus Forge: Deep Work Prime, Sprint Focus, Flow Sculpt
- Calm Compass: Rapid Reset between blocks
- Optional: pink noise base layer during intensive tasks

## 📈 Tracking & Metrics

- Output quality and quantity per block
- Distraction events and recovery time
- Subjective focus ratings pre/post

## 🧭 Guidance

- Batch tasks and minimize context switching
- Respect recovery windows—fatigue undermines output
- Weekly review to tune protocol timing and environment
