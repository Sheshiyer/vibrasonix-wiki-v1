# VIBRASONIX WIKI PROJECT MEMORY

## Overview
Vibrasonix Wiki is a Next.js-based interactive knowledge hub for sound therapy, featuring glassmorphism UI design and comprehensive documentation integration. The project aims to connect UI components with markdown documentation from the `/docs` directory while implementing modern liquid glassmorphism effects and floating navigation.

## Current State Analysis
- ✅ Next.js 15.4.5 with TypeScript setup complete
- ✅ Tailwind CSS with glassmorphism components implemented
- ✅ Basic dashboard layout with navigation menu
- ✅ Section pages created for all 6 main areas
- ✅ MDX processing setup with rehype/remark plugins
- ✅ Framer Motion for animations
- ✅ Radix UI components integrated
- ✅ Basic glassmorphism components (GlassCard, LiquidBackground)

## Architecture Decisions
- Using Next.js App Router with grouped routes in `(sections)`
- MDX compilation with next-mdx-remote for dynamic content
- Glassmorphism design system with backdrop-blur effects
- Component-based architecture with reusable UI elements

## Key Components Identified
1. **DashboardLayout** - Main layout wrapper with navigation
2. **DashboardGrid** - Section overview cards
3. **GlassCard** - Glassmorphism container component
4. **LiquidBackground** - Animated background effects
5. **FrequencyExplorer** - Interactive component
6. **NavigationMenu** - Top-level navigation

## Documentation Structure
The `/docs` directory contains comprehensive markdown files organized by sections:
- `sonic-science/` - Scientific foundations
- `experience-library/` - Curated protocols
- `transformation-journeys/` - Progress tracking
- `research-observatory/` - Evidence library
- `community-cosmos/` - Social features
- `sonic-lab/` - Experimental zone
